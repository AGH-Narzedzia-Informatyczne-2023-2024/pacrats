Amazing Pac Rat game
## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
- Under 500mb of drive space available
- Make sure you have Python and PyGame installed on your machine. You can install PyGame using the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
### Installing
* Download and unpack the .zip file in desired folder
* Run .exe file
## Running the tests
We use manual tests that involve, testing functionality, user interface (UI) testing, performance testing, compatibility testing, bug testing and coding style testing.
### End to end tests
Testing functionality:
```
1) Gameplay Testing: Checking smoothness, response to player interactions, character behavior accuracy, and overall gameplay.
2) Game Levels Testing: Ensuring all levels are accessible, free of level-specific errors, and that objectives are clear.
3) Mission and Task Testing: Verifying if tasks and missions display correctly and can be completed without issues.
```
User Interface (UI) Testing:
```
1) Menu Testing: Verifying the proper functionality of all menu options.
2) HUD (Heads-Up Display) Testing: Ensuring UI elements like scoring, health bars, etc., display correctly and function as expected.
3) Control Testing: Checking if controllers, mouse, and keyboard function properly.
```
Performance Testing:
```
1) Load Testing: Examining how the game performs at various load levels, ensuring no disruptions in smoothness.
2) Loading Time Testing: Checking the loading times of the game, levels, and other elements.
```
Compatibility Testing:
```
1) Platform Testing: Ensuring the game functions correctly across different platforms (PC, consoles, mobile devices).
2) Various Operating Systems Testing: Verifying if the game operates correctly on different operating systems.
```
Bug Testing:
```
1) Scenario Testing: Searching for bugs by executing various in-game actions.
2) Save and Playback Testing: Checking if game saves and playback functions properly.
```
### Coding style tests
Code Formatting Testing:
```
1) Checking if the code is correctly formatted according to established rules.
  *This includes indentations, brackets, spaces, and spacing between code elements.
```
Naming Conventions Testing:
```
2) Verifying if variable, function, and class names adhere to established naming standards, ensuring they are descriptive and easily understandable.
```
Programming Style Testing:
```
3) Checking if the code follows a specific programming style, such as using brackets in a certain way or maintaining consistency in the use of programming language keywords.
```
Reporting and Corrections:
```
4) Generating a report on identified inconsistencies or issues within the code, followed by corrections to bring the code in line with the standards.
